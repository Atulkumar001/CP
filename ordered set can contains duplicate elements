ordered set can contains duplicate elements , we have to configure it in that way.  The tree structure from PBDS allows for customization of the ordering and equality comparison. By using less_equal<int> as the comparator, you essentially allow the tree to treat elements as equal even if they are the same, enabling the storage of duplicates
